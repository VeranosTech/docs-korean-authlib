"specification implementation to high-level framework integrations."

"Authlib is the ultimate Python library in building OAuth and OpenID "
"Connect clients and servers. It offers generic implementations of RFCs, "
"including OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, JWT and many more. It becomes a "
":ref:`monolithic` project that powers from low-level specification "
"implementation to high-level framework integrations."

"Authlib is a monolithic library. While being monolithic, it keeps "
"everything synchronized, from spec implementation to framework "
"integrations, from client requests to service providers."

#: ../../basic/intro.rst:28

"The benefits are obvious; it won't break things. When specifications "
"changed, implementation will change too. Let the developers of Authlib "
"take the pain, users of Authlib should not suffer from it."

"You don't have to worry about monolithic, it doesn't cost your memory. If"
" you don't import a module, it won't be loaded. We don't madly import "
"everything into the root **__init__.py**."

"Authlib is designed as flexible as possible. Since it is built from low-"
"level specification implementation to high-level framework integrations, "
"if a high level can't meet your needs, you can always create one for your"
" purpose based on the low-level implementation."

"Most of the cases, you don't need to do so. Flexible has been taken into "
"account from the start of the project. Take OAuth 2.0 server as an "
"example, instead of a pre-configured server, Authlib takes advantage of "
"``register``."
